Changes

1. Migrate from `LocalBroadcastManager` to our own `LocalBroadcaster`.
2. Replace Intent/Bundle with `DataBag` (a class with maps)
3. Draw a clear line between "Authorization Request" and "Broker Interactive session" - to improve readability.
   3.1 The result returned from broker will have a separate set of return code (AuthenticationConstants.BrokerResponse).
   3.2 The result returned from broker will has its own broadcast alias (RETURN_BROKER_INTERACTIVE_ACQUIRE_TOKEN_RESULT)
   3.3 Due to 4.2, the returned result will no longer take a long trip via CommandDispatcher -> InteractiveTokenCommand -> BrokerMsalController. We will register/unregister the broadcast event in `BrokerMsalController.acquireToken()` directly. 
   3.4 Renamed `BaseController.notify()` to `BaseController.onFinishInteractiveSession()`, because that's what it really does.
   3.5 Renamed `BaseController.completeAcquireToken()` to `BaseController.onFinishAuthorizationSession()`, because Authorization is a subset of acquireToken.
4. Consolidate the shared logic in `MicrosoftStsAuthorizationResultFactory` and `AzureActiveDirectoryAuthorizationResultFactory` into the base class `AuthorizationResultFactory`
5. (Try to) consolidate the 'redirect URL interpreter' logic from `BrowserAuthorizationFragment` and `AzureActiveDirectoryWebViewClient` into `RawAuthorizationResult`.
   - The idea is... you pass in the result URL in the factory method, we'll intepret it.
   - This will also abstract out the bundle/dataBag from those classes - you don't need to know how the data is packed/sent throughout the code, we'll do that for you.
   - eSTS error in redirect uri is now handled in only one place - `AzureActiveDirectoryWebViewClient`. The current logic is associating those error with the error code that should be used for client-side error (this logic is not consistent in all path).



Other smaller changes
1. Migrate IDevicePopManager to common4j.
   - DevicePopManager will take context in via its constructor, as the method interface is now java-only.
2. Add IDevicePopManager and ClockSkewManager to ICommonComponents.
3. Delete android-common's `Device` class, along with its global IDevicePopManager.
4. OAuth2StrategyParameters now takes ICommonComponents instead of Context.
5. Turns `AuthorizationStrategy` into `AndroidAuthorizationStrategy` and `IAuthorizationStrategy` (because we'll need one for Linux).
